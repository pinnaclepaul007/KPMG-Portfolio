Stage 1: Data Quality Assessment - This stage deals with the data cleaning and sorting. Most importantly, looking into the three datasets provided for data quality issues and strategies to mitigate the data quality concerns. The data assessment was done using the "Data Quality Framework" provided. The 'Customer Demographic', Customer Address' and 'Transactions' were assessed based on the framework. I've attached the file for this stage.
Stage 2: Data Exploration & Insights - This stage analyses the existing datasets to determine the customer trends and behaviour. A power point presentation was done to show the approach for completing the analysis which includes understanding data distributions and trends, data transformation, modelling, result interpration and reporting. RFM analysis was performed to determine which customer a business should target in order to increase it revenue and value.
Stage 3: A dashboard was build in this stage to show the trends and also the customer with the highest value. It also shows bike purchased in the last 3 years based on gender. The goal was to know which high valued customers the company should focus on from the new customer list of 1000 customer.
